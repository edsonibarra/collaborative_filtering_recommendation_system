# Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System

Recommendation systems are widely used in a number of applications to give a personalized user experience. Collaborative filtering uses the information of other users or items in the system to filter out information. A user-based (user-user) collaborative filtering recommendation system is a memory-based approach that utilizes the users’ interactions with the system to find similar users and recommend them the items that similar users have liked.

In this project, I worked with an IMDB movie dataset to create a recommendation system for the users using the scikit-learn library, and then we’ll use the Streamlit library to build a simple recommender application.
